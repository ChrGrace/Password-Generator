# Random password generator.

## Description:

The app can generate a random, strong and secure password for users, utilising or excluding upper case, lower case, numeric or even special characters.
With a maximum limit of 128 characters, this generator can provide a near endless array of extremely strong passwords to keep the user safe.

## Languages used:

html, css and jss, however as instructed I only manipulated and worked with the javascript.


## Installation:

N/A as the application is entirely usable from the browser

## Usage

User must click the large, red 'generate password' button and then follow the pop-up prompts to input the desired length of the password, between 8-128 characters, allow or disallow the use of uppercase, lowercase, numeric or special characters and then a password will be printed. 
If the user types an invalid number in for character length, or rejects all character type, they will be met with an error message and prompted to try again.
